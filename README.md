# KNN-Distance-Metrics-Classifier

This repository contains a machine learning project that utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification with various distance metrics, including Minkowski, Euclidean, and Manhattan. It demonstrates how to preprocess data, find the optimal value of K, and evaluate the classifier's performance with different distance functions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

### Usage
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Hendawyy/KNN-Distance-Metrics-Classifier.git
cd KNN-Distance-Metrics-Classifier
```
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the KNN classifier with different distance metrics and analyze the results.

Customize the code to work with your own datasets or adjust the distance metrics and K values as needed.

### Results

The code provides:

- Optimal K selection
- Confusion matrices for Minkowski, Euclidean, and Manhattan distances
- Classification reports
- Accuracy scores for each distance metric
